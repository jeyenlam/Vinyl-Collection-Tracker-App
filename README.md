# Vinyl-Collection-Tracker-App
Introducing a web app for Discogs users to intuitively manage their vinyl collections without the clutter of extra features.


<h2>Synopsis</h2>
The aim of this project is to have a comprehensive and simple web application capable of showing Discogs' users their vinyl collections and related features only. 

<h2>Features</h2>
  <li>Sign-in/Sign-up via Discogs</li>
  <li>Search Vinyls</li>
  <li>Add/Delete Vinyls to/from Collections</li>
  <li>Log out</li>

<h2>Development</h2>
The development process utilizes Flask, HTML, CSS, and integration with the Discogs API. Initially, we set up the Flask application framework and established routing for the login, home, and profile pages. Next, we integrated Discogs API keys for communication. Then, we configured user authentication using OAuth and created API endpoints to retrieve data. Simultaneously, we designed dynamic pages to display vinyl data and implemented advanced features like a search bar and vinyl collection management. Finally, we refined the application's data structures and styles for a polished final product.

<h2>Verification</h2>
We conducted testing of API endpoints and their integration with the frontend interface. Additionally, we also tested the application's responsiveness under diverse load conditions to enhance the software responsiveness. Following this, our focus shifted towards security testing. We also utilized the Pylint and PyCodeStyle packages to identify the applicationâ€™s errors, potential bugs, and enforce coding standards. In terms of system requirements, we communicated closely with every member of the team during the application development to make sure the product comes out as how everyone is expecting it to be.
